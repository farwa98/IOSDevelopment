## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Tiktok- contains various videos and easy to use.
Instagram- love the reels and love to post on it.
YouTube- has all types of content and easy to use. 

I would like to build TikTok. It will have all of the features TikTok has right now with a few advancements. Some advancements that I will implement are it will allow users to hide the number of views on their video, enable face ID in chat, and auto-scroll.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a hard time controlling + dragging from the button on storyboard to somewhere inside of the ViewController class.
